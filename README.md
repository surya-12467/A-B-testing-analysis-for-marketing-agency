# A-B-testing-analysis-for-marketing-agency
A/B Testing (also called split testing )is a method used by marketing agencies to compare two versions of a marketing asset (A vs. B) to determine which one performs better.  It is a data-driven experiment where one variable is changed while keeping everything else constant.  
Marketing agencies use A/B testing to:

✅ Improve ad performance
✅ Reduce marketing costs
✅ Increase conversions (sales, signups, leads)
✅ Understand customer behavior
✅ Make decisions based on data, not guesswork
